## Concept
Simple Android app that exercises Spotify libraries for auth and player/playlists.

Use Spotify Auth SDK to auth.
Use Spotify SDK to control player, manage playlists, and discover music (recommendation via Echo Nest).
Use Amazon Rekognition API to take pictures (selfies or otherwise) and determine facial "sentiment."
Based on sentiment auto start a corresponding playlist.
(Don't steal my concept, patent pending -- and don't search for patent pending on github!)

Other ideas:
* do the opposite of sentiment, cheer me up, make me sad?
* allow key recommendation inputs to be specified, danceability, speechiness, popularity, etc
* show more relevant ads based on sentiment?
