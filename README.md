## Concept
Simple Android app that exercises Spotify libraries for auth and player/playlists.

Use Spotify Auth SDK to auth.   
Use Spotify SDK to control player, manage playlists, and discover music (recommendation via Echo Nest).   
Use Google Vison API to process images (selfies or otherwise) and determine facial "sentiment."   
Based on sentiment auto start a corresponding playlist.   

Other ideas:
* do the opposite of sentiment, cheer me up, make me sad?
* allow key recommendation inputs to be specified, danceability, speechiness, popularity, etc
* show more relevant ads based on sentiment?
